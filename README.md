# Euchre Coach

This Euchre Coach was designed to be a "perfect memory" for a player of the midwestern card game Euchre. It tracks and displays all available information to the user - which players are void in which suits, the current strongest card in each suit, etc.

I made it to help me better understand the game and its strategies, because it was hard for me to fully understand certain strategies without seeing them played out. You can use it to visualize and play through strategies for practice, or for (perfectly legal!) card-counting during a game on another device.
                
Enjoy.
